# discord-bot.py
An example discord bot in python.
I am attempting to clean up my own discord bot and upload it for others to see.

Login token inside config folder

The bot is fully run by Cogs, If you want to add your own Cogs or replace mine you should beable to with minimal change to the bot.
  Note: add your cog with directory to config/cogs file for it to load on bot startup.
